Package: wiffy
Developer: prurigro
* Comes from what appears to be an unmaintained collection of scripts.
  It assumes file locations different from where Arch puts them (eg: it checks
  for /usr/systemd/system/NetworkManager.service, which Arch has in
  /usr/lib/systemd), resulting in incorrect operation until we patch it.
* It performs essentially the same function as wifite-git, and unlike wiffy,
  wifite-git appears to be maintained, uses distro-agnostic settings, and is (in
  my opinion) higher quality overall.

Package: jdk,jre
Developer: prurigro
* The version we currently have in the repo is an older (out of date) v7 build
  that happens to be the version before Oracle stopped legally allowing their
  version of Java to be distributed by third parties.
* No packages appear to explicitly depend on the Oracle version, as opposed to
  openjdk 7 or 8, while some packages needing a more up to date version could
  in theory end up breaking.
