* [karma-hostapd](http://digi.ninja/karma/) - Karma is a set of patches to access point software to get it to respond to probe requests not just for itself but for any ESSID requested. This allows the AP to act as a lure to draw in any clients probing for known networks. The original Karma patches were released by Dino Dia Zovi for Madwifi, I then took over and ported the patches to Madwifi-ng and have now taken them to the new hostapd.

* [mosquito](https://github.com/koto/mosquito) - Mosquito is a XSS exploitation tool allowing an attacker to set up a HTTP proxy and leverage XSS to issue arbitrary HTTP requests through victim browser (and victim cookies).

Mosquito is extremely valuable when exploiting Google Chrome extensions, because via using XSS is extension content script it can usually issue arbitrary cross-domain HTTP requests (breaking the usual Same Origin Policy restrictions).

With this tool attacker can exploit content-script XSS vulnerabilities in extensions based on manifest v1 and v2. Author: [Krzysztof Kotowicz](http://blog.kotowicz.net/) [@kkotowicz](https://twitter.com/kkotowicz)
