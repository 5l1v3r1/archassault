Newest Tools Added:

* [damm-git](http://www.504ensics.com/tools/differential-analysis-of-malware-in-memory-damm/) - An open source memory analysis tool built on top of Volatility. It is meant as a proving ground for interesting new techniques to be made available to the community. These techniques are an attempt to speed up the investigation process through data reduction and codifying some expert knowledge.

* [bdfproxy-git](https://github.com/secretsquirrel/BDFProxy) - Patch Binaries via MITM: BackdoorFactory + mitmProxy. 

* [crowbar](https://github.com/galkan/crowbar) - A brute forcing tool that can be used during penetration tests. It is developed to support protocols that are not currently supported by thc-hydra and other popular brute forcing tools. 

* [subbrute-git](https://github.com/TheRook/subbrute) - SubBrute is a community driven project with the goal of creating the fastest, and most accurate subdomain enumeration tool. Some of the magic behind SubBrute is that it uses open resolvers as a kind of proxy to circumvent DNS rate-limiting (https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA13-088A). This design also provides a layer of anonymity, as SubBrute does not send traffic directly to the target's name servers.
