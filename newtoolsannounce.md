* [meterssh](https://github.com/trustedsec/meterssh) - MeterSSH is a way to take shellcode, inject it into memory then tunnel whatever port you want to over SSH to mask any type of communications as a normal SSH connection. The way it works is by injecting shellcode into memory, then wrapping a port spawned (meterpeter in this case) by the shellcode over SSH back to the attackers machine. Then connecting with meterpreter's listener to localhost will communicate through the SSH proxy, to the victim through the SSH tunnel. All communications are relayed through the SSH tunnel and not through the network.

* [ropper](https://scoding.de/ropper/) - With ropper you can show information about files in different file formats and you can find gadgets to build rop chains for different architectures. For disassembly ropper uses the awesome Capstone Framework. Ropper is inspired by [ROPgadget](http://shell-storm.org/project/ROPgadget/), but should be more than a gadgets finder. So it is possible to show information about a binary like header, segments, sections etc. Furthermore it is possible to edit the binaries and edit the header fields. Until now you can set the aslr and nx flags. Now you can generate rop chain automatically (auto-roper)  for execve and mprotect syscall.

* [pcapfix](http://f00l.de/pcapfix/) - tries to repair your broken pcap and pcapng files. To fix your pcap files the tool first checks for an intact pcap global header and repairs it if there are some corrupted bytes. It there seems to be no global header at all, pcapfix adds a self-created one at the beginning of the file. In a second step the tool tries to find pcap packet headers inside the file, below the global header. It checks if the values are correct (or seem to be correct) and tries to repair a packet if there is something wrong. To fix your pcapng files the tool loops through all packet headers that can be found in the file. It checks for mandatory Section Header and Interface Description Block and creates them if missing. Pcapfix checks for correct block sizes and valid option fields. If something is wrong, invalid fields are repaired (if possible) or skipped and adjusted to finally get a proper pcapng file.
