VMCloak is a tool to fully create and prepare Virtual Machines that can be used by Cuckoo Sandbox.

* [theZoo](https://github.com/ytisf/theZoo) - A repository of LIVE malwares for your own joy and pleasure. theZoo is a project created to make the possibility of malware analysis open and available to the public. Since we have found out that almost all versions of malware are very hard to come by in a way which will allow analysis we have decided to gather all of them for you in an available and safe way. **Please remember that there are live and dangerous malwares! They come encrypted and locked for a reason! Do NOT run them unless you are absolutely sure of what you are doing! They are to be used only for educational purposes (and we mean that!) !!!** Author: [Yuval Nativ](http://www.morirt.com)
