* [sagan](http://sagan.quadrantsec.com/) - Sagan is an open source (GNU/GPLv2) high performance, real-time log analysis & correlation engine that run under *nix operating systems (Linux/FreeBSD/ OpenBSD/etc). It is written in C and uses a multi-threaded architecture to deliver high performance log & event analysis. Sagan's structure and rules work similarly to the Sourcefire "Snort" IDS/IPS engine. This was intentionally done to maintain compatibility with rule management software (oinkmaster/pulledpork /etc) and allows Sagan to correlate log events with your Snort IDS/IPS system. Sagan can also write to Snort IDS/IPS databases via Unified2/Barnyard2. Sagan is compatible with all Snort "consoles". For example, Sagan is will work with [Snorby](http://www.snorby.org), [Sguil](http://sguil.sourceforge.net), BASE, the [Prelude IDS framework](https://www.prelude-ids.org) and proprietary consoles! (to name a few). [@dabeave666](https://twitter.com/dabeave666)
