Newest Tools Added:

* [meterssh](https://github.com/trustedsec/meterssh) - MeterSSH is a way to take shellcode, inject it into memory then tunnel whatever port you want to over SSH to mask any type of communications as a normal SSH connection. The way it works is by injecting shellcode into memory, then wrapping a port spawned (meterpeter in this case) by the shellcode over SSH back to the attackers machine. Then connecting with meterpreter's listener to localhost will communicate through the SSH proxy, to the victim through the SSH tunnel. All communications are relayed through the SSH tunnel and not through the network.

* [ropper](https://scoding.de/ropper/) - With ropper you can show information about files in different file formats and you can find gadgets to build rop chains for different architectures. For disassembly ropper uses the awesome Capstone Framework. Ropper is inspired by [ROPgadget](http://shell-storm.org/project/ROPgadget/), but should be more than a gadgets finder. So it is possible to show information about a binary like header, segments, sections etc. Furthermore it is possible to edit the binaries and edit the header fields. Until now you can set the aslr and nx flags. Now you can generate rop chain automatically (auto-roper)  for execve and mprotect syscall.

* [pcapfix](http://f00l.de/pcapfix/) - tries to repair your broken pcap and pcapng files. To fix your pcap files the tool first checks for an intact pcap global header and repairs it if there are some corrupted bytes. It there seems to be no global header at all, pcapfix adds a self-created one at the beginning of the file. In a second step the tool tries to find pcap packet headers inside the file, below the global header. It checks if the values are correct (or seem to be correct) and tries to repair a packet if there is something wrong. To fix your pcapng files the tool loops through all packet headers that can be found in the file. It checks for mandatory Section Header and Interface Description Block and creates them if missing. Pcapfix checks for correct block sizes and valid option fields. If something is wrong, invalid fields are repaired (if possible) or skipped and adjusted to finally get a proper pcapng file.

* [gr-gsm](https://github.com/ptrkrysik/gr-gsm) - The aim is to provide set of tools for receiving information transmitted by GSM equipment/devices. There are many possible applications of gr-gsm. At this moment there is one application that is ready out of the box. It is improved replacement of the old Airprobe - the program that lets you receive and decode GSM control messages from timeslot 0 on the broadcasting channel of a BTS. After installation of gr-gsm there are three python executables that will be installed: -airprobe_rtlsdr.py, -airprobe_file.py. The window of the program contains amplitude spectrum of the signal drawn in realtime. The central frequency of the signal can be changed by moving fc slider. The GSM signal has bandwidth of around 200kHz. By looking for constant hills on the spectrum of such width you can find a GSM broadcasting channel. By setting the fc slider to a carrier frequency of a broadcasting channel the program should immediately print content of subsequent messages on the standard output. If it doesn't happen set ppm slider into different positions. The slider is responsible for setting devices clock offset correction. If the clock offset is too large the clock offset correction algorithm that is implemented in the program won't work. There is intentionally added upper of allowable clock offset - it was done in order to avoid adaptation of the algorithm to neighbour channels that would inevitably lead to instability.

* [thcsmartbrute](https://www.thc.org/thc-smartbrute/) - This tool finds undocumented and secret commands implemented in a smartcard.An instruction is divided into Class (CLA), Instruction-Number (INS) and the
parameters or arguments P1, P2, P3. THC-SMARTBRUTE iterates through all the possible values of CLA and INS to find a valid combination. [Supported Devices](http://pcsclite.alioth.debian.org/ccid/supported.html)

* [snapception-git](https://github.com/thebradbain/snapception) - A tool to intercept and decrypt all snapchats received over your network. Author: [@thebadbrain](https://twitter.com/thebradbain)
