* [sipshock-git](https://github.com/zaf/sipshock) - A scanner for SIP proxies vulnerable to Shellshock.

* [ufonet](http://ufonet.sourceforge.net/) - a tool designed to launch DDoS attacks against a target, using Open Redirect vectors on third party web applications, like botnet.

* [wifiphisher-git](https://github.com/sophron/wifiphisher) - A Fast automated phishing attacks against WPA networks. Author: [@_sphron](https://twitter.com/_sophron)

* [snarf](https://github.com/purpleteam/snarf) - Snarf is a software suite to help increase the value of man-in-the-middle attacks. Many historical applications of techniques like SMB-Relay rely on assumptions, and relegate these attacks to exploitation, rather than the discovery / enumeration phase of the penetration test. While Snarf doesn't introduce new vulnerabilities, it does introduce a new capability to capitalize on exploiting familiar vulnerabilities. At its core, Snarf has one key principle in play: when you MITM something, don't throw it away. Don't just try to lob a payload through it and hope it works. Instead, we relay a connection for a client, and keep the connection to the server when the client is done. We hold onto it, and provide a facility to jack in additional tools to that same, preserved connection. This way, once we middle a connection, we can explore it. Use multiple tools, assess what privileges or rights we have, etc. -- all to give the penetration tester more direct control of the situation. You can find a [LIVE DEMO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBSrcrdRLyA&feature=youtu.be) or the [NOLAcon 2014 presentation PDF](http://www.josho.org/software/snarf-nolacon-presentation.pdf) 

* [faker](https://github.com/joke2k/faker) - Python package that generates fake data for you. Whether you need to bootstrap your database, create good-looking XML documents, fill-in your persistence to stress test it, or anonymize data taken from a production service, Faker is for you. Faker is heavily inspired by PHP's Faker, Perl's Data::Faker, and by ruby's Faker. [Main Site](http://www.joke2k.net/faker/) [@joke2k](https://twitter.com/joke2k)

* [malcom](https://github.com/tomchop/malcom) - Malcom is a tool designed to analyze a system's network communication using graphical representations of network traffic. This comes handy when analyzing how certain malware species try to communicate with the outside world. The aim of Malcom is to make malware analysis and intel gathering faster by providing a human-readable version of network traffic originating from a given host or network. Convert network traffic information to actionable intelligence faster.
